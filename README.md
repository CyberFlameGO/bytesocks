# bytesocks ðŸ§¦

bytesocks is a WebSocket server which allows clients to create "channels" and send messages in them.

It's effectively an add-on for [bytebin](https://github.com/lucko/bytebin) that supports using WebSockets to exchange data instead of HTTP get/post requests. A lot of the code is similar/copied, and it uses the same tech stack (Java, Jooby, Netty).
